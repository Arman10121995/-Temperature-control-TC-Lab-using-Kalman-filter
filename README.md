# -Temperature-control-TC-Lab-using-Kalman-filter
• Modeling of TC Lab (two temperature sensors and heaters mounted on Aurdino) in Matlab and Simulink. • Implementation of Kalman filter and Extended Kalman filter to estimate state using sensor fusion.  • Designed an integral Full State feedback controller to maintain the temperature at the desired set point.
